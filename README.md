# dahoam-challenge
My submission to the coding challenge for tickets to the dahoam developer conference 2019. I won. ðŸŽ‰

Setup was a fictional slot machine that had to be 'hacked'. I don't have the slot machine code - it was not part of the task.
The task was to alter the rewards of the slot machine. I included some messages with reference to Mr. Robot and added a backdoor that would request a file on my public keybase folder which let me control how much the reward was.

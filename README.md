# dahoam-challenge
My submission to the coding challenge to win tickets to the dahoam developer conference 2019. I won. 🎉

Setup was a fictional slot machine that had to be 'hacked'. I don't have the slot machine code - it was not part of the task.
The task was to alter the rewards of the slot machine. I included some messages with reference to Mr. Robot and added a backdoor that would request a file on my public keybase folder which let me control how much the reward was.

## payload
Originally the payload was hosted on a keybase.pub page. Keybase was bought by zoom and they shutdown the public pages. For the sake of completeness I added the file that was hosted on keybase to this repo.

## Who? What?
The challenge was release on [Entwicklerheld](https://entwicklerheld.de/). The conference was a developer conference organized by Bits & Pretzels in Munich. [Dahoam Conference on archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20190701222548/https://www.daho.am/)
